Large enterprises often invest in this area as they embark on these initiatives. In this post I wanted to talk about my top five reasons why I would build my digital applications platform on OpenShift</p>\n<p><strong>1) Choice of Running the platform where you want</strong></p>\n<p>This is super important. Most companies are now deploying workloads on multiple public clouds, on-premises sites and even on the edge and if I'm responsible for providing platform services for the entire company choice of running where I want to run my platform will be super critical otherwise as a platform provider I have to invest a lot in maintaining skillset within the team for public clouds, on-premises etc. You also have other concerns like developer experience. Most developers are now deploying workloads to on-premises and in multiple clouds and you want them to have a consistent experience developing, testing and deploying applications on platform. Openshift provides you this choice, weather you are an operator or a developer regardless of where you are running your platform you have the same consistent experience. You dont need to learn new tools, methods etc.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Managed Cloud Services</strong></p>\n<p>If you are running workloads in the cloud quite honestly speaking I just don't see why a customer would prefer to have a digital applications platform that they self manage.\nOpenShift dedicated gives you the same OpenShift experience in cloud provider of your choice without all the headaches of managing it. Quite honestly speaking from a developer perspective as long as I'm building on an enterprise platform whether its self managed or managed service is not going to be something I'd care much about as long as the experience of build/test/deploy and operate remains the same. OpenShift is also available as a native service in Azure (ARO) and AWS (ROSA).

Being compliant with industry and enterprise standards is critical to the success of any enterprise digital applications platform. OpenShift</p>\n<p><strong>4) Make your developers contribute code on Day 1</strong></p>\n<p><strong>5) Leveraging the benefits of digital platform on day 1</strong></p>","id":"3e75f00b-d8b8-5963-a924-620b29700985","frontmatter":{"title":"Five reasons why I would buid my digital applications platform on OpenShift","date":"July, 2022","tags":["OpenShift","Platform","Kubernetes","Digital"]},"fields":{"slug":"/build-your-platform-with-ocp/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Kubernetes"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1468229134","1611934721"]}
