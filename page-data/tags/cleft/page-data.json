London Marathon is a long distance running event help every year in London in Spring.</p>\n<p>As I set out on my journey, I have pledged to raise $5000 for Smile Train and the many children living with untreated clefts in the developing world. Through your support, we will be able to provide free cleft repair surgery for 20 children with clefts, giving them not only a new smile, but a second chance at life.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/smile-train-london-marathon1.jpg?raw=true\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Millions of children in developing countries are living with untreated clefts. Most cannot eat or speak properly and aren’t allowed to attend school or hold a job. Smile Train empowers local medical professionals to provide free cleft surgery and comprehensive cleft care to children in the developing world. Leveraging this ‘teach a man to fish’ approach to cleft care; Smile Train advances a sustainable solution and scalable model to treat clefts, drastically improving children’s lives, including their ability to eat, breathe, and speak over time. Smile Train Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization (tax ID# 13-3661416).</p>\n<p>Cleft surgery is safe and can cost as little as $250 and can take as little as 45 minutes. As you can imagine, there is still so much work to do. Smile Train is the world’s leading cleft charity. If you aren’t familiar, clefts are a major problem in developing countries where there are more than one million children who are suffering with unrepaired clefts. Children born with clefts are forced into lives of isolation and shame- all because of the way they look. And their clefts usually go untreated because they either don’t know there is a simple fix, or they are too poor to afford this simple surgery. A simple surgery that will drastically change a child’s life forever.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, with your help and the help of Smile Train, we can change a child’s life forever.</p>\n<p>Join me as I support Smile Train and race to give these children a second chance at life.
