In this post, I will go over how we can do just that for Docker.</p>\n<h1>Approach</h1>\n<p>You can get a list of known security vulnerabilities using <a href=\"http://www.cvedetails.com\">www.cvedetails.com</a> website. Known security vulnerabilities can be searched by the vendor, product, version etc.\nBelow RSS feed will provide you all known security vulnerabilities for Docker\n<a href=\"http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-feed.php?vendor_id=13534&#x26;orderby=3&#x26;cvssscoremin=0\">http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-feed.php?vendor_id=13534&#x26;orderby=3&#x26;cvssscoremin=0</a></p>\n<p>If you want to further filter down by specific product or version you can simply add \"product_id\" and/or \"version_id\" to the query string. To find the product id or version id <a href=\"http://www.cvedetails.com\">www.cvedetails.com</a> site provides product search and version search capabilities, once you have found the product through the search capability you can simply copy the product id and/or version id from the address bar in your browser and include it in the query string for above RSS feed URL</p>\n<p>From the above RSS feed URL vendor id \"13534\" is for Docker.</p>\n<p>Create a slack channel named \"docker\" in your slack workspace where we can post all security vulnerabilities related to Docker as well as have all docker related discussions.</p>\n<p>Copy the above RSS URL and issue following command in the slack channel.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">/feed subscribe http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-feed.php?vendor_id<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token number\">13534</span><span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span><span class=\"token assign-left variable\">orderby</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span><span class=\"token assign-left variable\">cvssscoremin</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Before you subscribe to RSS feed verify that it's not already subscribed by issuing command below which will list out all the RSS feeds that are already subscribed</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">/feed list</code></pre></div>\n<p>Once you receive an announcement you should evaluate it and if you are affected by it patch or mitigate the risk, test it and notify everyone.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps...</p>\n<p>Cheers,\nRam</p>","id":"2fa0ad21-16a7-5e7f-9322-bf288514155a","frontmatter":{"title":"Automatically get latest Docker security vulnerabilities posted to slack channel","date":"October, 2017","tags":["docker","cve","security","slack"]},"fields":{"slug":"/post-docker-security-updates-to-slack/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"cve"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1611934721","2366241629"],"slicesMap":{}}
