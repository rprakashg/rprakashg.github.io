London Marathon is a long distance running event help every year in London in Spring.</p>\n<p>As I set out on my journey, I have pledged to raise $5000 for Smile Train and the many children living with untreated clefts in the developing world. Through your support, we will be able to provide free cleft repair surgery for 20 children with clefts, giving them not only a new smile, but a second chance at life.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/smile-train-london-marathon1.jpg?raw=true\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Millions of children in developing countries are living with untreated clefts. Most cannot eat or speak properly and aren’t allowed to attend school or hold a job. Smile Train empowers local medical professionals to provide free cleft surgery and comprehensive cleft care to children in the developing world. Leveraging this ‘teach a man to fish’ approach to cleft care; Smile Train advances a sustainable solution and scalable model to treat clefts, drastically improving children’s lives, including their ability to eat, breathe, and speak over time. Smile Train Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization (tax ID# 13-3661416).</p>\n<p>Cleft surgery is safe and can cost as little as $250 and can take as little as 45 minutes. As you can imagine, there is still so much work to do. Smile Train is the world’s leading cleft charity. If you aren’t familiar, clefts are a major problem in developing countries where there are more than one million children who are suffering with unrepaired clefts. Children born with clefts are forced into lives of isolation and shame- all because of the way they look. And their clefts usually go untreated because they either don’t know there is a simple fix, or they are too poor to afford this simple surgery. A simple surgery that will drastically change a child’s life forever.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, with your help and the help of Smile Train, we can change a child’s life forever.</p>\n<p>Join me as I support Smile Train and race to give these children a second chance at life. Please visit my secure, personal fundraising page to make a donation and help me reach my goal of 20 new smiles for children in need. <a href=\"https://my.smiletrain.org/fundraiser/rprakashg\">https://my.smiletrain.org/fundraiser/rprakashg</a></p>\n<p>If you feel more comfortable sending a check, please include a note with my name so that Smile Train knows to add it to my fundraiser.

I hadn't been to build for at least 3-4 years now, but it is still a top-notch developer event that everyone should attend if you have an opportunity, especially if you build or plan to build applications on Azure cloud platform. Build is famously known for many swag giveaways in the past which seems to be not the case anymore, but the quality of content and speakers are still top notch.</p>\n<p>My path to \"Build 2018\" conference was completely unexpected, back in April I came across a tweet by <a href=\"https://lenadroid.github.io/posts.html\">Lena Hall</a> one of the Azure Advocates talking about Azure Dev tour in Seattle.\n<img src=\"/images/twitter2.png?raw=true\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I tried to register for this event, but unfortunately, I was a bit late I guess. I did not know the event was sold out when I fired off this reply.\n<img src=\"/images/twitter1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I got this response from awesome Allison one of the Azure Advocates and organizers of the Azure dev tour.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/twitter3.png?raw=true\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Long story short, I not only got a pass to attend the Azure dev tour, got an invite to attend Build and a wonderful gift from Allison. Thank you for showing kindness to a complete stranger. I'll never forget it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/twitter4.png?raw=true\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Through \"Azure Dev\" tour and \"Build\" I got to know and hang out with many Azure Advocates, and I have to say <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffsand\">Jeff Sandquist</a> and Microsoft have indeed assembled a group of remarkable individuals who are not only super technical and knowledgeable in their respective areas but also wonderful individuals who care deeply about DevRel and community.\nYou'll find Azure advocates speaking at many conferences and events, if you get a chance go attend one of those events, say hi to them, if you are already building on Azure platform tell them about your experience, speak to them about your design and technical problems, etc. trust me you won't regret it :)</p>\n<h2>Day 1</h2>\n<p>Day 1 keynote was split into two.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Vision keynote led by Microsoft CEO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/satyanadella\">Satya Nadela</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Technology keynote led by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/scottgu\">Scott Guthrie</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Watch vision keynote <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rDLkKN8e8rA\">here</a></p>\n<p>Watch technology keynote <a href=\"https://youtu.be/G9615XmUfas\">here</a></p>\n<p>My key areas of focus through out the conference was containers, IoT, Big Data processing, AI and Machine learning.</p>\n<p>Below are links to recordings of few of my favorite sessions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2018/BRK3223\">Build Intelligent applications by infusing knowledge from the web</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2018/THR3504\">Real time data streams with Apache Kafka and Spark</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2018/BRK2137\">What's new for Serverless Computing on Azure</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2018/BRK3802\">Azure IoT Edge: a breakthrough platform and service running cloud intelligence on any device</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2018/THR3202\">A Developer’s Introduction to Big Data Processing with Azure Databricks</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2018/THR3124\">Smart Insights with Machine Learning from Azure Monitoring</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Day 2</h2>\n<p>Day 2 technology keynote was focussed mostly on Windows and Office.

Hearing stories from people that have gone through the program, their journey was so incredible and inspiring. I also heard Jeff Sandquist speak for the first time, you could tell from his speech he genuinely cared about the cause and called upon us to act and make a difference.</p>\n<p>Here is pic (used from Twitter) of a young lady named \"Alana Andres\" who was brave enough to share her story with us.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/alanaandres.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There was also a panel discussion with lots of good questions and discussions. I came away inspired and wanting to do something to make a change. You can support unloop by donating, more info <a href=\"https://www.un-loop.org/donate\">here</a> I've made a monthly pledge and hoping to speak about this with our internal T-Mobile team.</p>\n<h2>Day 3</h2>\n<p>There was no technology keynote on day 3.

As a Marvel comics fan, I enjoyed the Marvel exhibits. I've uploaded all the pictures I took while I was at build to Google photos. Check out the album <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/VwjMrqk3N5YpKUMr1\">here</a></p>\n<p>Overall build was a blast, hope to be back next year hopefully as speaker. Massive shout out to the team behind build for the job they did pulling together an event like this, finally huge thanks to Azure Advocates for inviting me.
