After my interview I never thought I would end up getting the gig because my background was in Azure and Microsoft stack and the group I interviewed with was on Java/OSS workloads and on AWS. Even though I got the gig I was not sure if it would be a good move. Since I was doing training between consulting gigs I din't feel like I should rush getting into a gig.</p>\n<p>I've never been one hesitant to make changes and the opportunity to work on AWS, Microservices, OSS stack was too good to pass.\n2016 ended up being a good year as I worked my behind off learning and transitioning to AWS cloud, Linux &#x26; OSS technologies, I gained many new skills but most importantly deployed many dockerized microservices and numerous other features and enhancements to production. During this time I gained many new friends and work became fun for me again. I had found my passion that I had lost somewhere down the line.</p>\n<p>After contracting with T-Mobile for a year I've accepted a full time opportunity as Principal Architect on January 17th of this year.</p>\n<p>Moral of the story? Keep an open mind, work your behind off, see the big picture, don't hesitate to make changes, you must definitely catch the trend and ride it and most importantly have fun doing it.</p>\n<p>Cheers,\nRam</p>","id":"1b39ed35-7692-5bf8-9f5a-69b3f83dcf31","frontmatter":{"title":"New beginings","date":"February 19, 2017","tags":null},"fields":{"slug":"/new-beginings/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":3,"skip":15,"numPages":6,"currentPage":6}},"staticQueryHashes":["1468229134","1611934721"]}
