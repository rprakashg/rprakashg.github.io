I hadn't been to build for at least 3-4 years now, but it is still a top-notch developer event that everyone should attend if you have an opportunity, especially if you build or plan to build applications on Azure cloud platform. Build is famously known for many swag giveaways in the past which seems to be not the case anymore, but the quality of content and speakers are still top notch.</p>\n<p>My path to \"Build 2018\" conference was completely unexpected, back in April I came across a tweet by <a href=\"https://lenadroid.github.io/posts.html\">Lena Hall</a> one of the Azure Advocates talking about Azure Dev tour in Seattle.\n<img src=\"/images/twitter2.png?raw=true\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I tried to register for this event, but unfortunately, I was a bit late I guess. I did not know the event was sold out when I fired off this reply.\n<img src=\"/images/twitter1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I got this response from awesome Allison one of the Azure Advocates and organizers of the Azure dev tour.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/twitter3.png?raw=true\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Long story short, I not only got a pass to attend the Azure dev tour, got an invite to attend Build and a wonderful gift from Allison. Thank you for showing kindness to a complete stranger. I'll never forget it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/twitter4.png?raw=true\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Through \"Azure Dev\" tour and \"Build\" I got to know and hang out with many Azure Advocates, and I have to say <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffsand\">Jeff Sandquist</a> and Microsoft have indeed assembled a group of remarkable individuals who are not only super technical and knowledgeable in their respective areas but also wonderful individuals who care deeply about DevRel and community.\nYou'll find Azure advocates speaking at many conferences and events, if you get a chance go attend one of those events, say hi to them, if you are already building on Azure platform tell them about your experience, speak to them about your design and technical problems, etc. trust me you won't regret it :)</p>\n<h2>Day 1</h2>\n<p>Day 1 keynote was split into two.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Vision keynote led by Microsoft CEO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/satyanadella\">Satya Nadela</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Technology keynote led by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/scottgu\">Scott Guthrie</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Watch vision keynote <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rDLkKN8e8rA\">here</a></p>\n<p>Watch technology keynote <a href=\"https://youtu.be/G9615XmUfas\">here</a></p>\n<p>My key areas of focus through out the conference was containers, IoT, Big Data processing, AI and Machine learning.</p>\n<p>Below are links to recordings of few of my favorite sessions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2018/BRK3223\">Build Intelligent applications by infusing knowledge from the web</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2018/THR3504\">Real time data streams with Apache Kafka and Spark</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2018/BRK2137\">What's new for Serverless Computing on Azure</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2018/BRK3802\">Azure IoT Edge: a breakthrough platform and service running cloud intelligence on any device</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2018/THR3202\">A Developer’s Introduction to Big Data Processing with Azure Databricks</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2018/THR3124\">Smart Insights with Machine Learning from Azure Monitoring</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Day 2</h2>\n<p>Day 2 technology keynote was focussed mostly on Windows and Office.

I also heard Jeff Sandquist speak for the first time, you could tell from his speech he genuinely cared about the cause and called upon us to act and make a difference.</p>\n<p>Here is pic (used from Twitter) of a young lady named \"Alana Andres\" who was brave enough to share her story with us.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/alanaandres.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There was also a panel discussion with lots of good questions and discussions. I came away inspired and wanting to do something to make a change.

As a Marvel comics fan, I enjoyed the Marvel exhibits. I've uploaded all the pictures I took while I was at build to Google photos. Check out the album <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/VwjMrqk3N5YpKUMr1\">here</a></p>\n<p>Overall build was a blast, hope to be back next year hopefully as speaker. Massive shout out to the team behind build for the job they did pulling together an event like this, finally huge thanks to Azure Advocates for inviting me.

My personal blog is created using hugo and hosted on AWS S3. I recently did some work to dockerize it and thought I'd write about it.</p>\n<p>First thing I needed to do was create a docker image with hugo installed so I can build my hugo site. For more info on the docker image see the Dockerfile contents below, you can also check out the git repository <a href=\"https://github.com/rprakashg/hugo-docker\">here</a>. As you can see from the below snippet, nothing major is going on here, I'm using golang alpine image as a base and then installing hugo and adding hugo to the system path.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">FROM golang:1.8.3-alpine\n\nENV HUGO_VERSION 0.25 \nENV HUGO_BINARY hugo_${HUGO_VERSION}_linux-64bit \nENV PATH=/usr/local/hugo:${PATH}\n\nRUN set -x \\\n    &amp;&amp; apk upgrade --update \\\n    &amp;&amp; apk add --update ca-certificates bash curl wget \\\n    &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/cache/apk/* \\\n    &amp;&amp; mkdir /usr/local/hugo \\\n    &amp;&amp; wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/${HUGO_BINARY}.tar.gz -O /usr/local/hugo/${HUGO_BINARY}.tar.gz \\\n    &amp;&amp; tar xzf /usr/local/hugo/${HUGO_BINARY}.tar.gz -C /usr/local/hugo/ \\\n  &amp;&amp; rm /usr/local/hugo/${HUGO_BINARY}.tar.gz \\\n    &amp;&amp; rm -rf /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* </code></pre></div>\n<p>In my Dockerfile for my personal hugo based blog I use multi stage builds feature in docker to generate static HTML using hugo.

Even though its pretty minor you are sort of locked into AWS. Docker gives me freedom to run it anywhere and I love it :)</p>\n<p>Hope that helps...</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Ram</p>","id":"328875e5-fcc3-5a19-b0fd-4c9bda79266d","frontmatter":{"title":"Dockerizing Hugo Sites","date":"November 11, 2017","tags":["hugo","docker","blog"]},"fields":{"slug":"/dockerizing-hugo-sites/"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"It's extremely important to always be aware of all the announcements related to security issues for the products you use and support within your company, If you use slack we can have all these…","html":"<p>It's extremely important to always be aware of all the announcements related to security issues for the products you use and support within your company, If you use <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">slack</a> we can have all these announcements posted directly to a slack channel.
